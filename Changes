Revision history for Perl module Rose::DBx::Object::Cached::CHI

0.20 Mon Oct  1 13:51:17 EDT 2012
    - Fix for calling created_at on undef value

0.19 Mon Aug 20 00:28:47 EDT 2012
    - Keep modified columns from original object
      when saving to cache

0.17 Sat Nov 14 22:40:49 EST 2009
    - Fix for columns that use aliases.  
      Need to call the column's accessor function

0.16 Thu Aug  6 09:26:16 EDT 2009
    - set $expire_in variable to reduce function calls in remember()
    - Making is_cached_in_sync an OPTIONAL function that MUST BE TURNED ON
      The extra call to get the CHI object slows down speed of the module considerably
    - Also made the default memory store work with the latest version of CHI

0.14 Thu Feb  5 20:53:10 EST 2009
    - The CHI Object is returning undef even if the set is successful.  This appears to be something
      within the CHI module, but needs to be investigated further.  For now the workaround proposed 
      by Chris Alef is being used.
    - LEVEL seperators were changed to '&' for full compatibility with memcached. Thanks to Joshua Braegger.


0.13 Sat Dec  6 10:00:01 EST 2008
    - Needed to acount for columns that have triggers associted with them.  CODEREFs were not being
      handeled correctly by Storable.

0.12 Tue Nov 11 01:24:48 EST 2008
    - Too many function calls occuring in remember(). Created a safe object at the top of the subroutine
      to be used for all the cache set() calls. Thanks David Bourget

0.11 Mon Nov 10 22:59:04 EST 2008
    - Sorry for all the updates so close together, actually wrote some more tests.  Found bugs.
    - Check for valid response on setting objects. Thanks David Bourget
    - Some objects were not expiring correctly.  This has been fixed with a call directly to the meta class

0.08
    - Since save() ends up calling the insert() or the update() methods we do not need to also implement save()

0.07 Mon Sep 22 18:29:44 EDT 2008
    - Adding a default_cached_objects_settings class method 
    - Fixed how expires_in is checked
    - Adding local insert and update methods so these objects will be remembered by the cache.

0.06 Mon Sep 22 11:14:26 EDT 2008
    - Fixed perldoc

0.05 Sun Sep 21 19:52:01 EDT 2008
    - Fixed number of tests to skip if no DB
    - use Rose::DB::Object::Helpers ()

0.04 Sat Sep 20 00:38:38 EDT 2008
    - Included all tests in the MANIFEST file
    - Removed un-needed commented out code
    - Now reference functions that did not change from Rose::DB::Object::Cached 
    - Renamed subs clone and strip to internal names as not to conflict with Rose::DB::Object::Helpers

0.03 Fri Sep 19 10:38:38 EDT 2008
    - first working version deployed to CPAN

0.01 Thu Sep 18 16:08:20 2008
